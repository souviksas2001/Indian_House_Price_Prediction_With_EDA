# Indian_House_Price_Prediction_With_EDA
"Indian House Price Prediction With EDA" refers to a data analysis and predictive modeling project focused on estimating the prices of houses in India using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. This type of project typically involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources, such as real estate websites, government databases, or other relevant sources. This data should include information about different properties, including features like location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities, and, most importantly, the selling prices.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step is crucial because the quality of the data directly impacts the accuracy of the predictive model.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset. This may involve visualizations, statistical summaries, and data transformations to better understand the relationships between variables. EDA helps in identifying patterns, trends, and potential correlations between features and the target variable (house prices).

4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones based on insights gained during EDA. Feature engineering can help improve the predictive power of the model.

5. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

6. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning or statistical model for the prediction task. Common models for house price prediction include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.

7. **Model Training**: Train the selected model on the training dataset. This involves fitting the model to the data and optimizing its parameters.

8. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess how well it predicts house prices.

9. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters to improve its predictive accuracy.

10. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset, which contains data the model has not seen during training.

11. **Model Interpretation**: Interpret the model's results and understand which features have the most significant impact on house prices.

12. **Deployment**: If the model performs well, it can be deployed in a real-world application where it can provide price predictions for new or existing house listings.

The goal of "Indian House Price Prediction With EDA" is to create a reliable predictive model that can estimate house prices accurately. This can be valuable for various stakeholders, including homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals, as it provides insights into property values and market trends.
